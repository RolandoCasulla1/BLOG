    <h1>PLAZA</h1>
    <h3>One of the remarkable aspects of plazas is their ability to host a myriad of activities. From farmers' markets to art exhibitions, from musical performances to community gatherings, plazas serve as versatile canvases for diverse forms of expression. By endorsing plazas, we are endorsing spaces that accommodate the richness of our cultures and allow them to flourish.</h3>
